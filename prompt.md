# clanker translate

This is an LLM-powered translator which allows you to provide additional context for your translation and view an explanation of the translation so you can be confident that the translation is accurate even if you don't understand it.

I am currently on a trip in Japan. I don't speak Japanese, but I'm trying to learn. Often, I need to translate something, but google translate is unreliable and naive. It doesn't know the context of your conversation, which is often important, especially in a language/culture like Japanese where there are many variants of words based on your intended level of politeness and the setting in which you're speaking.

I want to create an LLM-powered translator that allows users to provide additional context to inform translation, and also include an explanation so they can be confident in the translation.

Translations should be generated by an LLM like ChatGPT or Claude or others. At least for the initial prototype, I want it to be a static webpage with no backend, hosted on GitHub pages. To support this, we'll need users to paste their API keys and we can store them in the browser with cookies or local storage so they don't need to paste it every time.

I would like to make this a mobile app at some point, so it would be ideal if we could make this in such a way that turning it into a mobile app would be simple.
